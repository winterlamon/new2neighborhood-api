New2Neighborhood allows you to search for bars and restaurants using either your current location or by setting an address. When you've found a venue that strikes your fancy, you can save it to a list of venues for you to explore at your leisure. Think of it as your food and drink to-do list! Once you have visited a venue, you can mark it off and pat yourself on the back for your successful gastro expedition. Cheers to you, young explorer!
