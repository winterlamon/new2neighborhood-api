This is the Rails API for New2Neighborhood.

New2Neighborhood allows you to search for bars and restaurants using either your current location or by setting an address. When you've found a venue that strikes your fancy, you can save it to a list of venues for you to explore at your leisure. Think of it as your food and drink to-do list! Once you have visited a venue, you can mark it off and pat yourself on the back for your successful gastro expedition. Cheers to you, young explorer!

This app uses:

* Ruby on Rails API
* React
* Redux
* Materialize CSS
* React Materialize
* Foursquare API
* Google Maps via react-google-maps

## Installation

Before running the local server, set up the database by running `rails db:create` then `rails db:migrate` in the terminal.

To run the API on your local server to use with the front-end repo, the server should be set to port 3001. The port can be set in the terminal by running `rails s -p 3001`.
